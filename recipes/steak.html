  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Summers are made for the grill, but what's a steak lover to do when the weather's too cold
    and wet to light the suckers up? Just cook them indoors. Indeed, pan-seared steaks have several
    distinct advantages over grilled steaks—enough that there are times when given the two choices, 
    I'll choose pan-seared just for the sake of it. While grilling will get you a rapid-fire crust 
    on your steak with all those delightfully crisp, on-the-verge-of-burnt bits and a good smoky flavor,
    I find that the even golden brown crust you can develop in a hot cast-iron pan really accentuates the flavor of the beef itself, 
    letting it shine. On top of that, pan-searing affords you the opportunity to add your own flavorings in the form of aromatics.

  <p><strong> Of course, you gotta know how to do it before you can git 'er done.</strong></p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 large bone-in T-bone or ribeye steak (see note)</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable or canola oil</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons (45g) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>6 sprigs thyme or rosemary (optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup finely sliced shallots (about 1 large; optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Carefully pat steak dry with paper towels. Season liberally on all sides, including edges, with salt and pepper. </li>
    <li>In a 12-inch heavy-bottomed cast iron skillet, heat oil over high heat until just beginning to smoke.</li>
    <li>Add butter, herbs (if using), and shallot (if using) to skillet and continue to cook, flipping steak occasionally and basting any light spots with foaming butter. </li>
    <li>Continue flipping and basting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of tenderloin side registers 120 to 125°F (49 to 52°C) for medium-rare or 130°F (54°C) for medium, 8 to 10 minutes total</li>
    <li>Immediately transfer steak to a large heatproof plate and pour pan juices on top. Let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Carve and serve.</li>
  </ol>
