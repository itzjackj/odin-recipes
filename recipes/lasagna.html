  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Lasagna noodles need structure, especially because they have a lot of ingredients layered 
    between them! You don't want to make 'em too mushy, which can be easy to do accidentally 
    because they're cooked twice: once in the boiling water, and once in the oven. Make sure to 
    cook them until they're very al dente in the boiling stage: They're ready typically 2 to 4 
    minutes before the amount of time on the box!
  </p>
  <p><strong>Don't listen to the box of lies and look instead for the thin white line in the 
    middle of your noodle when you go in to take a little test nibble.</strong></p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3/4 lb. lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
    <li>2 lb. ground beef</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375ยบ. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground beef until no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and drain fat. Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and stir until warmed through.  </li>
    <li>Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. </li>
    <li>In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce across the bottom of the dish, then top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a layer of meat sauce. Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella. </li>
    <li>Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400ยบ and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Garnish with parsley before serving.</li>
    
  </ol>
